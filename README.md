# from-pixels-to-wisdom

Welcome to my series, "From Pixels to Wisdom", where we'll explore the exciting world of Computer Vision and Machine Learning and their potential to unlock insights and knowledge from data. In this series, we'll dive into cutting-edge techniques and best practices for deploying them successfully in production environments and at scale.

A positive transformation occurs in the machine learning industry, where the emphasis shifts from merely achieving functional models to ensuring they align with the organisation's requirements. However, through my experience with ML systems over the past years, I have discovered that effectively creating, delivering, and operating ML models in an efficient, repeatable, and scalable manner is a challenging endeavour.
